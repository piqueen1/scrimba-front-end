    <h1 class=header>What Scrimba has Taught Me -- <strong><em>and how!</em></strong></h1>
    <p class="intro">The online Scrimba platform has taught me a number of cool things in a variety of ways.  Here are some of my favorites.</p>
    <h2 class="games-projects">Games and Projects</h2>
    <p>The first game I really enjoyed was Pacman.  I learned how to model a grid off a huge array spaced like the grid will be, and I learned to programmatically generate divs with <strong>createElement</strong> and <strong>appendChild</strong>, two important methods of manipulating the DOM through JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Snake is another game with similar building blocks as it also involves traversing a grid using <strong>classList.add('<em>class</em>')</strong> and <strong>classList.remove('<em>class</em>')</strong>.  It also involved using the modulus operator to test if the snake hit a wall. </p>
    <p>Several minor apps were fun to make as well, including a journal app in which I learned about displaying and hiding a DOM node by setting <strong>node.style.display = none</strong>.  In an emoji self-expression app we used <strong>myEmojis.push('<em>emoji</em>')</strong> to add emojis and <strong>myEmojis.pop('<em>emoji</em>')</strong> to remove them.</p>
    <h2>Lessons and Challenges</h2>
    <p>Because this isn't my first rodeo, I initially skipped to the HTML and CSS Challenges instead of doing the Module 2 lessons in order.  Later on I returned to watch every CSS and HTML lesson from the beginning, sometimes <strong>while taking a bath</strong>.</p>
    <p>I learned little interesting things in them, as I did in the JavaSript basics, so I am glad I watched them all (I'm actually still in the process of going back and doing it, whence comes the webpage you are reading.</p> 
    <p>One fun thing about the lessons is that they are taught by a variety of individuals with interesting accents and intonation patterns.  That way if I get sick of one person's voice I can jump to another lesson and another person's voice for a while.</p>
    <h2>Discord and Github</h2>
    <p>Two collaborative platforms are also making this adventure more interesting: Discord, which is a community-building platform with direct messaging like Slack, and GitHub, the classic version control website.  Discord is motivating because I have new friends who might look at my work and GitHub is very motivating with the little green dots that record daily commits.  My current streak is the longest in two years.</p>
