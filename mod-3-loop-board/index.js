const squares = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.grid div'))

//Challenge: We use what we have learnt in the previous three lessons in order 
//to visually colour a game board in our browser. At the moment the board is empty. 
//Please colour the squares, similar to like you would on a chess board using the 
//for loop.

//Don't forget to share your code in the #share-your-code channel on discord.
